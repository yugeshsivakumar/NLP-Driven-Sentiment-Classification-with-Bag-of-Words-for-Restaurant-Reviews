# NLP-Driven Sentiment Classification with Bag of Words for Restaurant Reviews

## Overview

This project focuses on sentiment classification of restaurant reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project leverages the Bag of Words model to vectorize text data and employs a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether a review is positive or negative.

The following components are covered:

## Project Components

- Text Preprocessing (Cleaning, Tokenization, Stemming)
- Vectorization using Bag of Words
- Sentiment Classification using Naive Bayes

Each component is implemented in the Jupyter notebook, and the corresponding dataset is provided for experimentation and learning.
